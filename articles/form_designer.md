# Form designer #

MobiDB Database Designer offers a convenient visual form designer that helps users create forms (card view of an entry).  It opens automatically when you create a new database and add at least one table. You are offered to set designer grid properties, such as number of columns in the grid. This setting allows more precise location of the controls on the form and allows more optimal use of space on a screen.
The designer can also be opened from the existing table or card by pressing the corresponding menu item in the navigation panel.
