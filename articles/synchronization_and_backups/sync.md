# Synchronization set up #

Cloud synchronization feature allows you to sync database between devices and even between different users (multi-user synchronization article can be found [here](share_multi.md)). Sync database to one of the cloud storages with just a couple of clicks. Google Drive, Dropbox or OneDrive sync is currently supported.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data sync is performed manually each time you would like to save changes to cloud service.
